# dotfiles (stow branch)
These are my personal dotfiles with a little script (`make.sh`) that uses `stow` to generate a symlink to your `~` folder. Imma try to create an alternate script that doesn't require `stow` to work... maybe.

## to-do
- [ ] Add config files for `vim`
- [ ] Install instructions
