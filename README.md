# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles. You can generate the symlinks to the home (`~`) directory using either `makestow.sh` which uses `stow` to manage symlinks, or the custom `makescript.sh` which doesn't use `stow` to generate them.
I highly recommend using `makestow.sh` to gen the symlinks. Really, please.

## to-do
- [ ] Add config files for `vim`
- [ ] Install instructions
