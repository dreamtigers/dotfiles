# dotfiles
These are my personal dotfiles with a little (and hopefully soon-to-be enhaced) script (`make.sh`) that generates a symlink to your `~` folder.

## to-do
- [] Enhace the `make.sh` script (current one doesn't produce symlink for the `nano.d` directory)
- [] Add config files for `vim`
- [] Install instructions
